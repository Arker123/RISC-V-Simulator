To run the GUI, first go to the `client` folder and run the following command:

```
npm i
```
This will install all the dependencies required for the client side.

Then, go to the `server` folder and run the following command:
```
npm i
```
This will install all the dependencies required for the server side.

Now, go to the server folder and run the following command:
```
node index.js
```
This will start the server.

Now, go to the `client` folder and run the following command:
```
npm start
```
This will start the client. The GUI will be available at http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. You can now send text commands from the GUI and receive the responses from the server which will be displayed on the GUI.
