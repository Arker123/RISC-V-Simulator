Information Related to Sizes:
1. Considering 2^32, the size of the memory space, so the number of bits required to address a memory location is 32.
2. We need the address of that block we are accessing
3. Cache and Tag Array are both dictionary
4. Considering 1 word is 4 bytes, so the number of bits required to address a word is 2. So, number of words = blocksize/wordsize = blocksize/4
